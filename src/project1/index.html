    <h2 class="red">About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Computer Science major. I've worked as a software engineer at startups and Fortune 500 companies alike,
        working on just about everything - from desktop to mobile to web - in logistics, entertainment, and security.
    </p>
    <p>That's really all there is.
        There's two <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements like the instructions said, but not much content.</p>

    <h2 class="blue">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy programming. I've contributed to dozens of open source projects and my contributions have been accepted
        into
        many major projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        My other interest is food. I enjoy cooking but enjoy eating even more so.
        I've recently started baking more since it was the one thing I was never very good at.
        I'm not great at it, but I am getting better.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently working on a Bachelor of Science with a Computer Science concentration.
        I've been working on it for the passed 6 years, which has been challenging in balancing work and school.
